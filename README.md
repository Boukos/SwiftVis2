This project is an updated version of SwiftVis written in Scala with better support for parallelism, support for JavaFX rendering,
and a programming interface.

SwiftVis2 is still in the early stages. I am focusing on adding basic plotting capability with the programming interface currently.
The graphical dataflow interface and other features will follow.
